\`Indexed\` means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is \`Indexed\`, .spec.completions must be specified and \`.spec.parallelism\` must be less than or equal to 10^5.

More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job.`
